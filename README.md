# MGRF local image feature descriptor

MGRF descriptor is built by Visual Studio 2015 and depended on OPENCV 3.1.0

You can download the all codes, and respectively create LMGRF and OMGRF Projects based on VS2015.

In LMGRF and OMGRF projects, command-line parameters need to be set as follows:

    -i img1.pgm -f img1.hesaff -o img1.hesaff.LMGRF -Order 6 -nSampling 4 -R 1
    -i img1.pgm -f img1.hesaff -o img1.hesaff.OMGRF -Order 6 -nSampling 4 -R 1
    
## Specificallyï¼Œ img1.pgm is the source image, img1.hesaff is the output file of Hessan-Affine Detector and its format is the same as Oxford affine format, as is shown below:

    1.0
    m
    u1 v1 a1 b1 c1
          :
          :
    um vm am bm cm

### Parameters defining an affine region

    u,v,a,b,c in a(x-u)(x-u)+2b(x-u)(y-v)+c(y-v)(y-v)=1 with (0,0) at image top left corner
    
## The meaning of other parameters are shown in the code detailly
